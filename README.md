# Adaptive Grouping-Based Genetic Algorithm (AG-GA)

This repository contains the implementation of the **Adaptive Grouping-Based Genetic Algorithm (AG-GA)** for hyperparameter optimization of neural networks. The AG-GA is compared with the traditional **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithms.

## Overview
- **AG-GA**: A novel genetic algorithm that uses adaptive grouping for better exploration and optimization.
- **GA**: Standard Genetic Algorithm for comparison.
- **PSO**: Basic Particle Swarm Optimization for comparison.

## Algorithms Compared
1. **AG-GA** (Adaptive Grouping Genetic Algorithm)
2. **GA** (Genetic Algorithm)
3. **PSO** (Particle Swarm Optimization)

## Results
The algorithms are compared using the **MNIST** dataset for neural network hyperparameter tuning. Results are stored in `results/` and include accuracy.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
